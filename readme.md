# Pong Of Death 
A direct translation of Frauber's original Pong of Death GameShark code. In their words:  

`What if, besides playing Mario 64, you had also to beat the computer in a game of Pong?`

Control the left paddle with **D-Up/D-Down**; the right paddle is controlled by the computer. First to **10 points** wins:  
- **Mario wins**: Earn rewards  
- **Computer wins**: Mario dies  

Computer skill and ball speed increase each stage.
